# AI Waste Classifier
This project uses Artificial Intelligence to identify different types of trash (like plastic or metal) for automatic sorting.
It was built using Python and a pre-trained model from Google Teachable Machine to recognize waste through a camera.
The repository contains the trained model files (`converted_keras`) and the Python scripts needed to run it.
To try it out, install the required libraries (`pip install tensorflow opencv-python`) and run `test.py`.
